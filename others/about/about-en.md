## Naming

The Chinese character of <span :lang="zh-Hans">Âçö</span>(wide, abundant, phono-semantical translation of 'blog'; /po/) was reconstructed as [p…ëk] in Middle Chinese. Among which, the open back unrounded vowel '…ë' (U+0251 <span style="font-variant: all-small-caps;">LATIN SMALL LETTER ALPHA</span>) is poorly supported in fonts, so a simpler transliteration 'Pak' is used.

Besides, talking about the motto 'This is a bl–æg, not a blŒøg', the first '–æ'(U+043E <span style="font-variant: all-small-caps;">CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER O</span>) is not the same character as the second 'o'(U+006F <span style="font-variant: all-small-caps;">LATIN SMALL LETTER O</span>)üòú.
